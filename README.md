# Algorithm Visualizer

The Algorithm Visualizer is a Java-based software application that offers a visual representation of various sorting algorithms. The program enables users to observe the sorting process step by step, enhancing their understanding of the algorithms and their underlying concepts.

## Features

- Interactive visualization of sorting algorithms
- Step-by-step demonstration of the sorting process
- Ability to navigate both forward and backward through sorting steps
- Customizable input options for providing data to be sorted
- Randomization feature to generate random input data

## Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/fauzanardh/BINUS-DataStructure-AlgorithmVisualizer`
2. Open the project in your preferred Java development environment.
3. Ensure that the necessary dependencies are configured (e.g., JavaFX).
4. Run the application: `./gradlew run`

## Usage

1. Launch the application.
2. Select the desired sorting algorithm from the available options.
3. Specify the input data (either manually or using the randomization feature).
4. Click the "Run" button to start the visualization.
5. Observe the sorting process step by step.
6. Use the forward and backward buttons to navigate through the sorting steps.
